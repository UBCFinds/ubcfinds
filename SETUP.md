# UBC Finds - Setup & Installation Guide

This document provides comprehensive instructions for setting up the **UBC Finds** development environment, configuring necessary cloud services (Google Maps, Supabase), and deploying the application to Vercel.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

*   **Node.js** (v18.0.0 or higher recommended)
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager)
*   **Git**
*   A **Google Cloud Platform** account (for Maps API)
*   A **Supabase** account (for Database)
*   A **Vercel** account (for Deployment)

---

## 2. Local Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ubcfinds/ubcfinds.github.io.git
    cd ubcfinds.github.io
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

---

## 3. Service Configuration

This application relies on two external services: Google Maps Platform and Supabase. You must set these up to run the app.

### A. Google Maps Platform

1.  Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  Create a new project (e.g., "UBC Finds").
3.  Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**.
4.  Search for and enable the **Maps JavaScript API**.
5.  Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
6.  Click **Create Credentials > API Key**.
7.  **Important:** Restrict your API key to prevent unauthorized use:
    *   Under "Application restrictions", select **HTTP referrers (web sites)**.
    *   Add `http://localhost:3000/*` for local development.
    *   Add your Vercel deployment domain (e.g., `https://ubc-finds.vercel.app/*`) once deployed.
8.  Copy the generated API Key.

### B. Supabase (Database)

1.  Log in to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
2.  Click **New Project**.
3.  Enter a name (e.g., "UBC Finds DB") and a secure database password.
4.  Select a region close to your users (e.g., US West).
5.  Once the project is created, go to **Project Settings > API**.
6.  Copy the **Project URL** and the **anon / public** Key.

#### Database Schema Setup
To enable the "Report Issue" functionality, you must create the `reports` table.
1.  In your Supabase dashboard, go to the **SQL Editor**.
2.  Paste and run the following SQL query:

```sql
create table public.reports (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  util_id text not null,
  util_name text not null,
  issue_type text not null,
  description text,
  status text default 'pending'
);

-- Set up Row Level Security (RLS)
alter table public.reports enable row level security;

-- Allow anyone (anon) to insert reports
create policy "Enable insert for everyone" 
on public.reports for insert 
with check (true);

-- Allow anyone to read reports (optional, depending on requirements)
create policy "Enable read access for all users" 
on public.reports for select 
using (true);
```

---

## 4. Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory of the project. This file is ignored by Git for security.

Paste the following content, replacing the placeholders with your actual keys from Section 3:

```bash
# Google Maps
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

---

## 5. Running the Application

### Development Server
To start the application locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Production Build
To simulate a production build locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

---

## 6. Testing

To ensure code quality and functionality, run the test suite.

*   **Run Unit Tests:**
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure your `package.json` has a test script configured, e.g., using Jest or Vitest).*

*   **Check Code Coverage:**
    ```bash
    npm run test:coverage
    ```

## 7. Deployment (Vercel)

The easiest way to deploy this Next.js app is using Vercel. This guide assumes you want to host your own version of the application.

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
If you haven't already, fork this repository to your own GitHub account so you have full access to connect it to Vercel.

### Step 2: Connect to Vercel
1.  Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
2.  On your dashboard, click **Add New > Project**.
3.  You will see a list of your GitHub repositories. Find your forked version of `ubcfinds.github.io` and click **Import**.

### Step 3: Configure Project
1.  **Framework Preset:** Vercel should automatically detect this as a **Next.js** project. Leave the build settings as default.
2.  **Environment Variables:** This is the most critical step. Expand the "Environment Variables" section. You must add the keys exactly as they appear in your local `.env.local` file.
    *   **Key:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | **Value:** (Your Google Maps API Key)
    *   **Key:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`      | **Value:** (Your Supabase Project URL)
    *   **Key:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | **Value:** (Your Supabase Anon Key)

### Step 4: Deploy
1.  Click **Deploy**.
2.  Vercel will now build your application. This process usually takes 1-2 minutes.
3.  Once complete, you will be presented with a screenshot of your app and a domain (e.g., `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`).

### Step 5: Post-Deployment Configuration
1.  **Update Google Maps Restrictions:** Go back to your Google Cloud Console credentials page. Add your new Vercel domain (e.g., `https://your-project-name.vercel.app/*`) to the allowed HTTP referrers list so the map loads correctly in production.
2.  **Update Supabase URL (Optional):** If you have strict CORS policies in Supabase, ensure your new Vercel domain is added to the allowed origins.

## 8. User Guide

This section explains how to use the **UBC Finds** application as a consumer.

### Accessing the Application
*   **Web:** Navigate to the deployed Vercel URL (e.g., `https://ubc-finds.vercel.app`).
*   **Mobile:** The application is fully responsive. Open the URL in your mobile browser for an app-like experience.

### Navigating the Map
*   **Pan & Zoom:** Use standard touch gestures (pinch/drag) or mouse controls to explore the UBC campus.
*   **My Location:** Click the "Location" icon (if available) to center the map on your current position.

### Finding Utilities
*   **Sidebar:** Use the collapsible sidebar to filter utilities by category (e.g., Water Fountains, Microwaves, Washrooms).
*   **Search:** Use the search bar at the top of the sidebar to find specific buildings or utility types.
*   **Markers:**
    *   **Blue Markers:** Indicate fully functional utilities.
    *   **Orange Markers:** Indicate utilities that have been reported for issues.

### Reporting Issues
If you encounter a broken or missing utility:
1.  Click on the utility marker on the map.
2.  In the detail popup, click the **"Report Issue"** button (exclamation mark icon).
3.  Select the type of issue (e.g., "Not Working", "Needs Maintenance").
4.  Add an optional description and click **Submit**.
5.  The marker will update to orange to alert other users.

## 9. Troubleshooting

*   **Map shows "For Development Purposes Only" or errors:**
    *   Check that the Google Maps API Key is correct in `.env.local`.
    *   Ensure the **Maps JavaScript API** is enabled in Google Cloud Console.
    *   Check if your billing account is linked to the Google Cloud project (required by Google).

*   **Supabase connection errors:**
    *   Verify the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
    *   Check the browser console for CORS errors; ensure your Supabase project allows requests from `localhost:3000`.

*   **"Report Issue" fails to submit:**
    *   Check the Supabase SQL Editor to ensure the `reports` table exists.
    *   Verify that the RLS (Row Level Security) policies allow `INSERT` operations for public/anon users.
